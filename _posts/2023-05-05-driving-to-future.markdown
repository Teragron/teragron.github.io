I was inspired by the idea of using technology to improve road safety after attending a driving course where the teacher showed me a video about automation in modern vehicles. One of the automation systems, called 'Line Tracking,' uses cameras or sensors to help drivers stay in their lane. 
However, I noticed that the roads we drive on still lack the advanced technology found in our cars. 
This discrepancy can cause alignment issues and threaten personal safety.

To address this problem, I propose the development of 'smart roads,' which could interact with vehicles and emit real-time data to assist drivers. 
This technology could replace conventional yellow lines and provide feedback control loops between vehicles and roads. 
Smart roads could use sensors, cameras, and communication networks to facilitate traffic management, road maintenance, and safety. 
Furthermore, smart road technology could enable autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently.

While the concept of smart roads is not new, implementing such a system would require significant investment and may pose technical and logistical challenges. 
It is crucial to ensure that any new technology is secure and respects privacy and data protection. 
Nevertheless, the potential benefits of using smart road technology to enhance road safety make this an idea worth exploring.
