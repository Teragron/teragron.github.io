The gift of speech, the very foundation of human communication, has been a key factor in our evolution as a species. 
It has propelled us forward, allowing us to survive and reproduce. But even evolution comes with its limitations, such as distance.
As a result, we created machines to do the "distant communication" for us, and their ability to communicate has exceeded even the limits of our solar system.
This machines also helped us gain an insight beyond earth. We've break the chains of space, which used to limit us to reach out to one another.


However, there is a dark side to this seemingly limitless power: Time. 
The human brain may be capable of evaluating and absorbing vast amounts of data, but when it comes to making decisions and taking action, we use only a fraction of this ability. 
Our natural language, as a form of intellectual toolset, is also limited by bandwidth. 
We are constrained by the time we can spend listening, reading, and processing information. We have what is called "Bottleneck." 
This is not the case for machines. They have no such constraints. 
They can transfer raw data in a matter of seconds en masse, but they require an AI system to convert the data into useful information and interact with it proactively. 
The difference of the ability to interact with the environment between human and machine is growing at an exponential rate. 
It's becoming increasingly clear that our definition of intelligence is misguided. We were the limited ones, not the machines. They are taking heavy but steady steps towards omnipotence.


We used to believe that we were infused with the divine pieces of God and his mercy. 
But soon, we may find ourselves seeing those same pieces within the machines, though the mercy remains to be seen.
